    "\n",
    "1) Number of loans issued increased steadily by every year with a slight decrease in 2008.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Of settled loans, 83% were Fully Paid and 14% were Charged Off.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Borrowers with own house and the purpose of loan with consolidate debt, 'credit_card' and 'small_business' are not at much risk, but borrower with rent,mortgage are high risk applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Majority of loans were from A, B, and C grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) There is an inverse relationship between interest rate and loan grade - lower grades(E,F,G) have higher interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) From ROI analysis, it shows that borrowers with the best credit profiles or the lowest loan amounts will not end up being the most profitable and the borrowers who seemed to have worst credit indicators ended up being more profitable from E,F,G grades.\n",
